# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Miull-Study-Case
This project involves the implementation of the study case of the 'Natural Language Processing' course on the Miull platform.

The project aims to predict tweets posted by Twitter users as positive, negative and neutral within the context of the emotions 
they carry. For this purpose, it includes the stages of missing value analysis, variable type transformations, deriving new 
variables, making arrangements on labels, separating categorical and numerical variables, target variable analysis, applying the 
TF-IDF method and making predictions using the logistic regression model.
